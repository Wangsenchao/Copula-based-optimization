In this project, we will take the UDWS of Guangming district as an example. 
Taking the code of Guangming District (i.e., folder of GM) as an example, the framework of the Matlab codes was composed by the following steps:
Step 1: Data sampling based on the document of sampling.m and annual historical data on water demand and GDP in the document of gmw.xlsx. A document (i.e., gm.xlsx) can be established after run the document of sampling.m.
Step 2: Historical data analysis based on the document of datacollect.m and gm.xlsx. A document (i.e., gmcollect1.xlsx) can be established after run the document of datacollect.m, with column A is the volume of annual "water volume" and column B is the volume of "GDP" from 2020-2030;The prediction of water demand in 2025 and 2030 of Guangming district was finished.
